# NeOnyx Theme

A dark theme with limited syntax highlighting.

Inspired by minimal light themes, Onyx uses minimal amount of highlighting. So that your editor does not like a colorful impressionist painting.

I forked this theme and changed it to provide support for italics, git diffs in the file tree, and some other color changes.
For example, types are colored as a lighter version of comments, and it provides support for primitive types. The idea behind this is that types fulfill the same purpose as comments:
to provide additional information to the reader as to the shape and style of the data.
Numbers were brightened to stand out a little more from the background. Increases accessibility, and brings them into better focus.
Punctuation marks are darkened to fall into the background. Punctuation marks are significantly less important than the content around them.
Badges are darkened. They ruin focus, and don't actually matter that much. Same with the status bar. They share the same color.
